== Description ==

This is the long description.  No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).

Plugin gets events from Facebook and lists them same as clubs.  Eventually a backend menu.

List of features we want:

*   Need some api connection to events.
*   Need page on which events are generated.
*   Need to create database table.
*   Need to create backend menu.
*   Need to overwrite content using backend (adding tickets)

== Installation ==

Like normal.  I'll send you a ZIP file and everything should work.
